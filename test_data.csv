"In This Article: The Nasdaq led US stocks higher on Wednesday as Netflix (NFLX) stock surged to a record, while Donald Trump's boost to AI demand hopes outweighed fresh tariff threats from the new US president. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 1.3%, bolstered by surprisingly strong earnings from Netflix, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.6%, to hover near its record closing high. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%, coming off a rise of over 500 points on a winning Tuesday on Wall Street. Trump is in the driving seat for markets, with investors on alert for any fresh move in the president's fast-flowing overhaul of policy. His latest push to make the US a leader in AI — an $500 billion private-sector investment plan and a roll-back of Biden-era safety measures — is giving a bump to techs. Shares in Oracle (ORCL), a partner in the ""Stargate"" venture, continued to rise, up roughly 7% on the prospect of higher AI spending. In Tokyo, SoftBank (9984.T, SFTBY) stock jumped 11%. Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) stock soared more than 11% in early trading after the streamer reported record new subscriber additions alongside beats on earnings and revenue. Spirits were high despite heightened worries about a Trump-spurred trade war. The president said Tuesday his administration was considering imposing a 10% duty on China imports on Feb. 1, as he vowed to hit the EU with additional tariffs. US stocks rallied on Tuesday amid relief that China wasn't targeted in Trump's first policy moves, which promised new duties for Mexico and Canada. Stocks in China fell on Wednesday as markets were rattled by the new trade-defense plan. Corporate earnings continued to roll in. Before the bell, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) posted quarterly sales and profit above estimates, but its stock slipped as investors weighed the impact of a strong dollar. Shares of Procter & Gamble (PG) popped after its sales also beat forecasts. Amazon hits a record high Shares of Amazon (AMZN) rose nearly 2% amid a broader tech rally on Wednesday to hit more than $234 per share, a fresh record high for the tech giant. Other ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks were in rally mode too. Meta (META) rose more than 1.5%, while Microsoft (MSFT) popped almost 3%, and Nvidia (NVDA) gained nearly 4%. Trump sparks an AI revival President Donald Trump announced a new $500 billion private sector investment dubbed ""Stargate"" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture. The announcement sent Oracle stock up more than 5% in early trade on Wednesday, extending gains from Tuesday's sessions when CBS news first reported the news. Zooming out, the president's commitment to investing in AI appeared to spark enthusiasm for a slew of stocks tied to the emerging technology. Both Nvidia (NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) were up more than 4% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, smaller AI companies C3.AI (AI) and Big Bear AI Holdings (BBAI) were both up near 5%. ""We believe this is the start of a wave of massive AI investments to take place in the US as we expect more big tech players to make announcements over the coming weeks,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday night. ""This comes at a critical juncture as we expect Trump to aggressively court more AI investments in the US with the China tariff negotiations in the background all part of a broader game of high stakes poker with China,"" Ives added Below is a full look at how AI-related stocks are performing in early trade on Wednesday. Netflix stock reaches all-time highs after monster earnings Netflix stock (NFLX) surged to all-time highs, trading over 13% higher in early trading on Wednesday, as Wall Street analysts praised the streaming media company's fourth quarter earnings results. Shortly after the opening bell, the stock surged to just under $1,000 a share as analysts rushed to increase their respective price targets. Pivotal Research upped its target from $1,000 a share to $1,250 — the highest on the Street. The streaming giant reported a whopping 18.9 million users in the fourth quarter, while revenue and earnings also handily beat expectations. It was the biggest quarterly subscriber gain in the company's history. Netflix also announced a $15 billion stock buyback and boosted its full-year revenue outlook in its after-hours report on Tuesday. Netflix now projects 2025 revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion, ahead of the prior $43 billion to $44 billion range. ""Q4 results were near flawless,"" Jefferies analyst James Heaney said in a note following the results. The strong subscriber gains come after the streamer ended 2024 with two back-to-back NFL games, a successful ""Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson"" boxing match, and the return of ""Squid Game."" To that end, the company said price hikes will be hitting the service — which analysts had consistently teased heading into the print. The company raised the price of its ad-supported plan to $7.99 from the prior $6.99 rate. Its Standard, ad-free tier will now be $17.99, up from $15.49, while its Premium plan will increase by $2 to $24.99. Users who want to add an extra member will now pay $8.99, an increase of $1.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.2%, coming off a rise of over 500 points on a winning Tuesday on Wall Street. The S&P 500 quickly shot up to 6,079.82, hovering just shy of its all-time intraday record high of 6,099.97. A word from Elon on his good friends at OpenAI There is little love lost between Elon Musk and OpenAI. And so when OpenAI — along with Oracle (ORCL) and SoftBank (9984.T) — was announced as part of the initial $100 billion investment into the Trump-backed AI infrastructure program, Stargate, the tech mogul and close Trump confidant could not help himself. Musk added that he has it on ""good authority"" that SoftBank, the deep-pocketed Japanese conglomerate run by Masayoshi Son, has under $10 billion in capital secured for this project. Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI — along with UAE-based AI investor MGX — are part of the initial equity backers of Stargate, which said Monday it would ""begin deploying $100 billion immediately."" Over the next four years, the project is planning to invest $500 billion to build new AI infrastructure in the US. Musk, who now runs his own AI firm, xAI, has been locked in a court battle with OpenAI over its planned conversion to a for-profit structure. Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman started the company together a decade ago as a non-profit entity aimed at building AI to advance humanity. Musk left the company in 2018. Good morning.

Apple (AAPL) shares fell Tuesday after Jefferies downgraded the stock to an “underperform” from “hold” on Monday, as flagging iPhone sales and weak demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) features in newer models are expected to lead the tech giant to undershoot quarterly revenue forecasts. Jefferies also cut its price target on Apple to $200.75 per share from $211.84 each.Apple is due to report its first quarter 2025 numbers on Thursday, Jan. 30. ""We lower forecasts driven by weak iPhone sales and the general [consumer electronics] market and our reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization,"" Jefferies analysts wrote, adding that the brokerage expects Apple to miss its first-quarter 2025 revenue guidance of 5% growth. They also said the tech firm's guidance for the March quarter ""could also disappoint."" JPMorgan Is Still Overweight But Lowers Price Target Separately, JPMorgan (JPM) analysts on Tuesday stuck with an overweight call on Apple but downgraded their price target to $260 from $265, citing wariness about the company's outlook. Among their concerns: The strong dollar at a time of limited appetite for Apple products, and ""flattish unit sales"" given the current AI features, as well as weak China demand. They said Apple will continue to lose market share in China as it's already ""past its product cycle peak"" and also the company's premium phones don't benefit from local government subsidies for low-to-mid-tier phones. Apple shares fell sharply last Thursday as data from research firm Canalys indicated the tech giant lost its coveted position as China's largest smartphone seller last year. Apple's China iPhones aren't equipped with its recently launched AI features. The stock is down about 3.5% Tuesday at around $222.40 and have lost almost 12% in 2025.

"In This Article: (Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s sovereign wealth fund is considering buying the minority stake in Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS held by LetterOne Holdings SA, which is partly-owned by sanctioned Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven, according to people familiar with the matter. Most Read from Bloomberg Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY’s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen The wealth fund, also known by its initials TWF and the biggest holder in Turkcell, has approached LetterOne to discuss a potential offer for its 19.8% stake, the people said. It’s unclear whether LetterOne is interested in selling its stake in the country’s largest wireless carrier by market value, the people said, asking not to be identified as the conversations remain private. Shares of Turkcell extended gains to more than 4% and TWF’s bonds due 2029 advanced on Wednesday following the Bloomberg News report. Turkcell’s shares have risen 61% in the past year, giving the company a market value of about $6.5 billion. A 19.8% stake would be worth around $1.3 billion based on current market price. Turkcell offers mobile and fixed networks to clients in Turkey and also has investments in Belarus, its website shows. TWF became Turkcell’s largest shareholder in 2020 and gained control of the board with its 26.2% holding, including a 15% privileged stake. One of Turkcell’s main competitors is Turk Telekomunikasyon AS, which is also owned by TWF. A potential acquisition of LetterOne’s stake in Turkcell could give the wealth fund a tighter grip on the country’s telecom market, while the fund isn’t subject to antitrust regulations. Fridman, Aven and their partners are sanctioned by the UK, European Union and the US after Russia started war on Ukraine in 2022, although LetterOne isn’t sanctioned. Fridman and the partners resigned from LetterOne board in the same year while the sanctions prevent them from getting proceeds from any deal. TWF has privately expressed concerns about potential risks to Turkcell from the sanctions, as the company is also listed in New York, the people said. Turkey, a NATO member, has refrained from joining its Western allies in imposing sanctions against Russia, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan maintaining friendly ties with President Vladimir Putin. TWF previously held informal discussions with potential buyers about selling its Turkcell stake, Bloomberg News reported in July. Some within the fund opposed a sale as the carrier is seen as a strategic asset, the people have said. Buying out LetterOne’s stake could make any potential future TWF’s divestment of its Turkcell shares easier, according to the people. Deliberations are preliminary and there’s no guarantee a deal would happen, the people said. Representatives for Turkcell and LetterOne declined to comment, while TWF didn’t respond to requests for comment. LetterOne and Turkcell were at odds before. In 2022, LetterOne called for the dismissal of four board members as it pushed for a governance overhaul to attract international investors. The board of Turkcell rejected most of LetterOne’s requests later. --With assistance from Yuliya Fedorinova.

"In This Article: Netflix stock (NFLX) surged to all-time highs, rising as much as 13.6% in early trading on Wednesday, as Wall Street analysts praised the company's fourth quarter earnings results. Shortly after the opening bell, the stock leaped to just under $1,000 a share as analysts rushed to increase their respective price targets. Pivotal Research upped its target from $1,000 a share to $1,250 — the highest on the Street. The streaming giant reported a whopping 18.9 million users in the fourth quarter while revenue and earnings also handily beat expectations. It was the biggest quarterly subscriber gain in the company's history. ""Q4 results were near flawless,"" Jefferies analyst James Heaney said in a note following the report. The company also announced a $15 billion stock buyback and boosted its full-year revenue outlook in its after-hours report on Tuesday. Netflix now projects 2025 revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion, ahead of the prior $43 billion to $44 billion range. The strong subscriber gains come as the streamer ended 2024 with two back-to-back NFL games, a successful ""Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson"" boxing match, and the return of ""Squid Game."" To that end, the company said price hikes will be hitting the service — which analysts had consistently teased heading into the print. The company raised the price of its ad-supported plan to $7.99 from the prior $6.99. Its Standard, ad-free tier will now be $17.99, up from $15.49, while its Premium plan will increase by $2 to $24.99. Users who want to add an extra member will now pay $8.99, an increase of $1. Wall Street had expected the streaming giant to report just 9.18 million subscribers after it secured 13.12 million paying users in Q4 2023. The company announced last spring it would stop reporting the metric at the start of this year. ""With no more sub reporting to come, investor focus shifts to Netflix's ability to monetize its member base; advertising and price increases help answer this,"" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen said on Wednesday. The company revealed advertising revenue doubled in 2024 and management guided to it doubling again in 2025. Still, ad revenue is not expected to become a primary revenue driver until 2026. Netflix's live events boom On the earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said the huge jump in subscribers wasn't driven by one particular event, despite its recent live sports programming push. ""We've consistently seen across our history no single title really drives a majority of our acquisition or engagement,"" Peters said, noting that live events accounted for a minority of new customers in the quarter. Analysts were largely encouraged by this commentary with Deutsche Bank's Bryan Kraft writing to clients, ""Management was very clear that the strength in 4Q net adds was not driven disproportionately by the Tyson vs Paul fight, the NFL, or any other title; therefore, we see no reason why the strength will not continue."" In November, the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson match attracted over 108 million global viewers, becoming the most-streamed sporting event of all time. For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers. Similarly, the NFL games averaged around 30 million viewers. According to Netflix, it was its most-watched Christmas Day ever in the US. The company will continue to double down on sports amid the recent debut of WWE Raw. Rumors have also swirled the company could bid on UFC rights next. Netflix said in its shareholder letter it's not focused on rights for ""large regular season sports packages; rather, our live strategy is all about delivering can’t-miss, special event programming."" Revenue hit $10.25 billion in Q4, beating Bloomberg consensus estimates for $10.11 billion and marking an increase of 16% compared to the same period last year. Netflix guided to first quarter revenue of $10.42 billion, a miss compared to consensus estimates of $10.48 billion. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) also beat estimates in the quarter, with the company reporting EPS of $4.27, above consensus expectations of $4.18 and well ahead of the $2.11 EPS figure it reported in the year-ago period. Netflix guided to fourth quarter EPS of $5.58, below consensus calls for $6.01. Other profitability metrics also came in strong, with operating margins sitting at 22.2% in the fourth quarter and 27% for full-year 2024. Netflix expects Q1 operating margins to expand to 28.2%. Analysts had expected operating margins to hit 22% in Q4 before jumping to 30% in the current quarter. ""Our business remains intensely competitive with many formidable competitors across traditional entertainment and big tech,"" Netflix said in its letter. ""We’re fortunate that we don’t have distractions like managing declining linear networks and, with our focus and continued investment, we have good and improving product/market fit around the world.""

"In This Article: Hindenburg Research was widely recognized as a top performer in the world of activist short selling. That's why its abrupt shutdown last week sent waves across an industry in which pointing out company fraud and misconduct has become one of the riskiest, burdensome, and loathed corners of Wall Street. Founder Nate Anderson gave no specific reason when he announced the closure of his firm, which rose to fame in 2020 with the short call of electric vehicle startup Nikola (NKLA). Since then, his targets have included Indian conglomerate Adani, holding conglomerate Icahn Enterprises (IEP), and most recently, server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI). “So why disband now? There is not one specific thing — no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue,” wrote Anderson on his firm's site. He credited Hindenburg's work for playing a role in nearly 100 individuals charged civilly or criminally, ""including billionaires and oligarchs."" But some industry watchers aren’t totally surprised to see the iconic short seller close shop a little more than a year after Jim Chanos, famous for wagering against Enron in 2001 also threw in the towel. “It’s a very tough business not just because markets rip and are built to go up, but it puts a lot of wear and tear on you,"" Carson Block, founder and chief investment officer of Muddy Waters Capital told Yahoo Finance. Simply put, the business of short selling in public has become increasingly scrutinized, litigious, and costly. ""Every year the bar to find 'stories,' for lack of a better word, that investors would care about gets higher,"" Block explained. ""There’s just more complacency built in because basically all this easy money was anesthetizing investors to risk."" Short sellers borrow shares of a company they believe will go down in value and sell them. Once the stock price drops, they buy the shares back and return them to the lender, making a profit on the downside. Activist short sellers go further: They make a living by publishing reports claiming fraud or other misconduct at a company — and gain when its stock falls. Industry insiders say their research may include information from hedge funds looking to avoid recognition. Depending on the structure of a deal, the research may be shared for free with the short-selling firm. Agreements can include shared profits or payment for legal fees in case the target company sues. Though hedge funds tend to use short selling as an ""insurance"" to reduce exposure against a market drawdown or correction, the practice of exposing overvaluation or fraud hasn't been widely appreciated by most investors in a bull market, said Drayton D'Silva, CEO and chief investment officer at Tower Hills Capital. ""There’s this —essentially animosity and resentment towards short sellers because typically the average person is always going long,” D'Silva said. “Yes [short selling] it does destroy value, but that value was always fake,” he added. The epic retail investor-led short squeeze of video game retailer GameStop (GME) in 2021 that resulted in billions of dollars in losses of former hedge fund Melvin Capital put the focus, at least in recent years, on the practice of short selling. The meme frenzy that ensued prompted greater scrutiny of the business of targeting overvalued stocks. ""There was greater attention by the public to short selling. And because there was greater attention by the public to short selling, I think that drove politician and regulatory interest,"" said Dan Taylor, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School. Enter the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year, the SEC announced charges against activist short seller Andrew Left and Citron Capital, in what regulators described ""as a $20 million multi-year scheme to defraud followers by publishing false and misleading statements related to stock trading recommendations."" In an interview with CNBC earlier this month, Left said, ""I’ve never been accused by the SEC or the DOJ of ever lying about a company. That’s the key thing. I speak the truth about companies."" Also, in early January the Securities and Exchange Commission implemented new disclosure requirements intended to bring more transparency about funds' short-selling practices. The rules require reporting to the SEC daily short positions of at least $10 million. The agency will publish the aggregate of daily activity within about 30 days after the end of each calendar month. Taylor believes such rules are ""too tough."" ""Why are we focusing here on disclosing short positions at the daily level, as opposed to both short and long positions at the daily level,"" Taylor said. ""It's not that one type of position is necessarily more manipulative or more suspicious."" Tough rules aside, activists may be in the midst of a self-imposed pause. ""I think there’s a cyclical component here, and we’re coming out of a period that has been really tough for activist short sellers,” said Block of Muddy Waters Capital, though he pointed out 2021 turned out to be a good year for short selling. Hindenburg's closure comes as the number of prominent players has declined in recent years. Breakout Point, a data analysis tracking site listed 42 active short seller firms last year, down from 62 in 2020. Even so, the timing of Hindenburg's disbanding remains an enigma. Among the top activists, Hindenburg has consistently ranked as a high performer, holding the No. 1 slot in 2024 based on the number of published reports, according to Breakout Point data. ""He’s basically going out on top,"" Block said. ""Most people when they leave short selling, it’s after they’ve experienced a reversal of fortune. So Nate’s ahead of the curve on that one.” Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X at @ines_ferre.
