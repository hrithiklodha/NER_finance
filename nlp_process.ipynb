The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 1.3%, bolstered by surprisingly strong earnings from Netflix, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.6%, to hover near its record closing high. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%, coming off a rise of over 500 points on a winning Tuesday on Wall Street. Trump is in the driving seat for markets, with investors on alert for any fresh move in the president's fast-flowing overhaul of policy. His latest push to make the US a leader in AI \\u2014 an $500 billion private-sector investment plan and a roll-back of Biden-era safety measures \\u2014 is giving a bump to techs. Shares in Oracle (ORCL), a partner in the \\\"Stargate\\\" venture, continued to rise, up roughly 7% on the prospect of higher AI spending. In Tokyo, SoftBank (9984.T, SFTBY) stock jumped 11%. Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) stock soared more than 11% in early trading after the streamer reported record new subscriber additions alongside beats on earnings and revenue. Spirits were high despite heightened worries about a Trump-spurred trade war. The president said Tuesday his administration was considering imposing a 10% duty on China imports on Feb. 1, as he vowed to hit the EU with additional tariffs. US stocks rallied on Tuesday amid relief that China wasn't targeted in Trump's first policy moves, which promised new duties for Mexico and Canada. Stocks in China fell on Wednesday as markets were rattled by the new trade-defense plan. Corporate earnings continued to roll in. Before the bell, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) posted quarterly sales and profit above estimates, but its stock slipped as investors weighed the impact of a strong dollar. Shares of Procter & Gamble (PG) popped after its sales also beat forecasts. Amazon hits a record high Shares of Amazon (AMZN) rose nearly 2% amid a broader tech rally on Wednesday to hit more than $234 per share, a fresh record high for the tech giant. Other \\\"Magnificent Seven\\\" tech stocks were in rally mode too. Meta (META) rose more than 1.5%, while Microsoft (MSFT) popped almost 3%, and Nvidia (NVDA) gained nearly 4%. Trump sparks an AI revival President Donald Trump announced a new $500 billion private sector investment dubbed \\\"Stargate\\\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture. The announcement sent Oracle stock up more than 5% in early trade on Wednesday, extending gains from Tuesday's sessions when CBS news first reported the news. Zooming out, the president's commitment to investing in AI appeared to spark enthusiasm for a slew of stocks tied to the emerging technology. Both Nvidia (NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) were up more than 4% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, smaller AI companies C3.AI (AI) and Big Bear AI Holdings (BBAI) were both up near 5%. \\\"We believe this is the start of a wave of massive AI investments to take place in the US as we expect more big tech players to make announcements over the coming weeks,\\\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday night. \\\"This comes at a critical juncture as we expect Trump to aggressively court more AI investments in the US with the China tariff negotiations in the background all part of a broader game of high stakes poker with China,\\\" Ives added Below is a full look at how AI-related stocks are performing in early trade on Wednesday. Netflix stock reaches all-time highs after monster earnings Netflix stock (NFLX) surged to all-time highs, trading over 13% higher in early trading on Wednesday, as Wall Street analysts praised the streaming media company's fourth quarter earnings results. Shortly after the opening bell, the stock surged to just under $1,000 a share as analysts rushed to increase their respective price targets. Pivotal Research upped its target from $1,000 a share to $1,250 \\u2014 the highest on the Street. The streaming giant reported a whopping 18.9 million users in the fourth quarter, while revenue and earnings also handily beat expectations. It was the biggest quarterly subscriber gain in the company's history. Netflix also announced a $15 billion stock buyback and boosted its full-year revenue outlook in its after-hours report on Tuesday. Netflix now projects 2025 revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion, ahead of the prior $43 billion to $44 billion range. \\\"Q4 results were near flawless,\\\" Jefferies analyst James Heaney said in a note following the results. The strong subscriber gains come after the streamer ended 2024 with two back-to-back NFL games, a successful \\\"Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson\\\" boxing match, and the return of \\\"Squid Game.\\\" To that end, the company said price hikes will be hitting the service \\u2014 which analysts had consistently teased heading into the print. The company raised the price of its ad-supported plan to $7.99 from the prior $6.99 rate. Its Standard, ad-free tier will now be $17.99, up from $15.49, while its Premium plan will increase by $2 to $24.99. Users who want to add an extra member will now pay $8.99, an increase of $1.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.2%, coming off a rise of over 500 points on a winning Tuesday on Wall Street. The S&P 500 quickly shot up to 6,079.82, hovering just shy of its all-time intraday record high of 6,099.97. A word from Elon on his good friends at OpenAI There is little love lost between Elon Musk and OpenAI. And so when OpenAI \\u2014 along with Oracle (ORCL) and SoftBank (9984.T) \\u2014 was announced as part of the initial $100 billion investment into the Trump-backed AI infrastructure program, Stargate, the tech mogul and close Trump confidant could not help himself. Musk added that he has it on \\\"good authority\\\" that SoftBank, the deep-pocketed Japanese conglomerate run by Masayoshi Son, has under $10 billion in capital secured for this project. Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI \\u2014 along with UAE-based AI investor MGX \\u2014 are part of the initial equity backers of Stargate, which said Monday it would \\\"begin deploying $100 billion immediately.\\\" Over the next four years, the project is planning to invest $500 billion to build new AI infrastructure in the US. Musk, who now runs his own AI firm, xAI, has been locked in a court battle with OpenAI over its planned conversion to a for-profit structure. Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman started the company together a decade ago as a non-profit entity aimed at building AI to advance humanity. Musk left the company in 2018. Good morning.

Apple (AAPL) shares fell Tuesday after Jefferies downgraded the stock to an \\u201cunderperform\\u201d from \\u201chold\\u201d on Monday, as flagging iPhone sales and weak demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) features in newer models are expected to lead the tech giant to undershoot quarterly revenue forecasts.

Among their concerns: The strong dollar at a time of limited appetite for Apple products, and \\\"flattish unit sales\\\" given the current AI features, as well as weak China demand. They said Apple will continue to lose market share in China as it's already \\\"past its product cycle peak\\\" and also the company's premium phones don't benefit from local government subsidies for low-to-mid-tier phones. Apple shares fell sharply last Thursday as data from research firm Canalys indicated the tech giant lost its coveted position as China's largest smartphone seller last year. Apple's China iPhones aren't equipped with its recently launched AI features. The stock is down about 3.5% Tuesday at around $222.40 and have lost almost 12% in 2025.

Most Read from Bloomberg Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen The wealth fund, also known by its initials TWF and the biggest holder in Turkcell, has approached LetterOne to discuss a potential offer for its 19.8% stake, the people said. It\\u2019s unclear whether LetterOne is interested in selling its stake in the country\\u2019s largest wireless carrier by market value, the people said, asking not to be identified as the conversations remain private. Shares of Turkcell extended gains to more than 4% and TWF\\u2019s bonds due 2029 advanced on Wednesday following the Bloomberg News report. Turkcell\\u2019s shares have risen 61% in the past year, giving the company a market value of about $6.5 billion. A 19.8% stake would be worth around $1.3 billion based on current market price. Turkcell offers mobile and fixed networks to clients in Turkey and also has investments in Belarus, its website shows. TWF became Turkcell\\u2019s largest shareholder in 2020 and gained control of the board with its 26.2% holding, including a 15% privileged stake. One of Turkcell\\u2019s main competitors is Turk Telekomunikasyon AS, which is also owned by TWF. A potential acquisition of LetterOne\\u2019s stake in Turkcell could give the wealth fund a tighter grip on the country\\u2019s telecom market, while the fund isn\\u2019t subject to antitrust regulations. Fridman, Aven and their partners are sanctioned by the UK, European Union and the US after Russia started war on Ukraine in 2022, although LetterOne isn\\u2019t sanctioned. Fridman and the partners resigned from LetterOne board in the same year while the sanctions prevent them from getting proceeds from any deal. TWF has privately expressed concerns about potential risks to Turkcell from the sanctions, as the company is also listed in New York, the people said. Turkey, a NATO member, has refrained from joining its Western allies in imposing sanctions against Russia, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan maintaining friendly ties with President Vladimir Putin. TWF previously held informal discussions with potential buyers about selling its Turkcell stake, Bloomberg News reported in July. Some within the fund opposed a sale as the carrier is seen as a strategic asset, the people have said. Buying out LetterOne\\u2019s stake could make any potential future TWF\\u2019s divestment of its Turkcell shares easier, according to the people. Deliberations are preliminary and there\\u2019s no guarantee a deal would happen, the people said. Representatives for Turkcell and LetterOne declined to comment, while TWF didn\\u2019t respond to requests for comment. LetterOne and Turkcell were at odds before. In 2022, LetterOne called for the dismissal of four board members as it pushed for a governance overhaul to attract international investors. The board of Turkcell rejected most of LetterOne\\u2019s requests later. --With assistance from Yuliya Fedorinova.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 1.3%, bolstered by surprisingly strong earnings from Netflix, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.6%, to hover near its record closing high. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%, coming off a rise of over 500 points on a winning Tuesday on Wall Street. Trump is in the driving seat for markets, with investors on alert for any fresh move in the president's fast-flowing overhaul of policy. His latest push to make the US a leader in AI \\u2014 an $500 billion private-sector investment plan and a roll-back of Biden-era safety measures \\u2014 is giving a bump to techs. Shares in Oracle (ORCL), a partner in the \\\"Stargate\\\" venture, continued to rise, up roughly 7% on the prospect of higher AI spending. In Tokyo, SoftBank (9984.T, SFTBY) stock jumped 11%. Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) stock soared more than 11% in early trading after the streamer reported record new subscriber additions alongside beats on earnings and revenue. Spirits were high despite heightened worries about a Trump-spurred trade war. The president said Tuesday his administration was considering imposing a 10% duty on China imports on Feb. 1, as he vowed to hit the EU with additional tariffs. US stocks rallied on Tuesday amid relief that China wasn't targeted in Trump's first policy moves, which promised new duties for Mexico and Canada. Stocks in China fell on Wednesday as markets were rattled by the new trade-defense plan. Corporate earnings continued to roll in. Before the bell, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) posted quarterly sales and profit above estimates, but its stock slipped as investors weighed the impact of a strong dollar. Shares of Procter & Gamble (PG) popped after its sales also beat forecasts. Amazon hits a record high Shares of Amazon (AMZN) rose nearly 2% amid a broader tech rally on Wednesday to hit more than $234 per share, a fresh record high for the tech giant. Other \\\"Magnificent Seven\\\" tech stocks were in rally mode too. Meta (META) rose more than 1.5%, while Microsoft (MSFT) popped almost 3%, and Nvidia (NVDA) gained nearly 4%. Trump sparks an AI revival President Donald Trump announced a new $500 billion private sector investment dubbed \\\"Stargate\\\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture. The announcement sent Oracle stock up more than 5% in early trade on Wednesday, extending gains from Tuesday's sessions when CBS news first reported the news. Zooming out, the president's commitment to investing in AI appeared to spark enthusiasm for a slew of stocks tied to the emerging technology. Both Nvidia (NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) were up more than 4% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, smaller AI companies C3.AI (AI) and Big Bear AI Holdings (BBAI) were both up near 5%. \\\"We believe this is the start of a wave of massive AI investments to take place in the US as we expect more big tech players to make announcements over the coming weeks,\\\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday night. \\\"This comes at a critical juncture as we expect Trump to aggressively court more AI investments in the US with the China tariff negotiations in the background all part of a broader game of high stakes poker with China,\\\" Ives added Below is a full look at how AI-related stocks are performing in early trade on Wednesday. Netflix stock reaches all-time highs after monster earnings Netflix stock (NFLX) surged to all-time highs, trading over 13% higher in early trading on Wednesday, as Wall Street analysts praised the streaming media company's fourth quarter earnings results. Shortly after the opening bell, the stock surged to just under $1,000 a share as analysts rushed to increase their respective price targets. Pivotal Research upped its target from $1,000 a share to $1,250 \\u2014 the highest on the Street. The streaming giant reported a whopping 18.9 million users in the fourth quarter, while revenue and earnings also handily beat expectations. It was the biggest quarterly subscriber gain in the company's history. Netflix also announced a $15 billion stock buyback and boosted its full-year revenue outlook in its after-hours report on Tuesday. Netflix now projects 2025 revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion, ahead of the prior $43 billion to $44 billion range. \\\"Q4 results were near flawless,\\\" Jefferies analyst James Heaney said in a note following the results. The strong subscriber gains come after the streamer ended 2024 with two back-to-back NFL games, a successful \\\"Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson\\\" boxing match, and the return of \\\"Squid Game.\\\" To that end, the company said price hikes will be hitting the service \\u2014 which analysts had consistently teased heading into the print. The company raised the price of its ad-supported plan to $7.99 from the prior $6.99 rate. Its Standard, ad-free tier will now be $17.99, up from $15.49, while its Premium plan will increase by $2 to $24.99. Users who want to add an extra member will now pay $8.99, an increase of $1.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.2%, coming off a rise of over 500 points on a winning Tuesday on Wall Street. The S&P 500 quickly shot up to 6,079.82, hovering just shy of its all-time intraday record high of 6,099.97. A word from Elon on his good friends at OpenAI There is little love lost between Elon Musk and OpenAI. And so when OpenAI \\u2014 along with Oracle (ORCL) and SoftBank (9984.T) \\u2014 was announced as part of the initial $100 billion investment into the Trump-backed AI infrastructure program, Stargate, the tech mogul and close Trump confidant could not help himself. Musk added that he has it on \\\"good authority\\\" that SoftBank, the deep-pocketed Japanese conglomerate run by Masayoshi Son, has under $10 billion in capital secured for this project. Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI \\u2014 along with UAE-based AI investor MGX \\u2014 are part of the initial equity backers of Stargate, which said Monday it would \\\"begin deploying $100 billion immediately.\\\" Over the next four years, the project is planning to invest $500 billion to build new AI infrastructure in the US. Musk, who now runs his own AI firm, xAI, has been locked in a court battle with OpenAI over its planned conversion to a for-profit structure. Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman started the company together a decade ago as a non-profit entity aimed at building AI to advance humanity. Musk left the company in 2018. Good morning.

Among their concerns: The strong dollar at a time of limited appetite for Apple products, and \\\"flattish unit sales\\\" given the current AI features, as well as weak China demand. They said Apple will continue to lose market share in China as it's already \\\"past its product cycle peak\\\" and also the company's premium phones don't benefit from local government subsidies for low-to-mid-tier phones. Apple shares fell sharply last Thursday as data from research firm Canalys indicated the tech giant lost its coveted position as China's largest smartphone seller last year. Apple's China iPhones aren't equipped with its recently launched AI features. The stock is down about 3.5% Tuesday at around $222.40 and have lost almost 12% in 2025.

Most Read from Bloomberg Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen The wealth fund, also known by its initials TWF and the biggest holder in Turkcell, has approached LetterOne to discuss a potential offer for its 19.8% stake, the people said. It\\u2019s unclear whether LetterOne is interested in selling its stake in the country\\u2019s largest wireless carrier by market value, the people said, asking not to be identified as the conversations remain private. Shares of Turkcell extended gains to more than 4% and TWF\\u2019s bonds due 2029 advanced on Wednesday following the Bloomberg News report. Turkcell\\u2019s shares have risen 61% in the past year, giving the company a market value of about $6.5 billion. A 19.8% stake would be worth around $1.3 billion based on current market price. Turkcell offers mobile and fixed networks to clients in Turkey and also has investments in Belarus, its website shows. TWF became Turkcell\\u2019s largest shareholder in 2020 and gained control of the board with its 26.2% holding, including a 15% privileged stake. One of Turkcell\\u2019s main competitors is Turk Telekomunikasyon AS, which is also owned by TWF. A potential acquisition of LetterOne\\u2019s stake in Turkcell could give the wealth fund a tighter grip on the country\\u2019s telecom market, while the fund isn\\u2019t subject to antitrust regulations. Fridman, Aven and their partners are sanctioned by the UK, European Union and the US after Russia started war on Ukraine in 2022, although LetterOne isn\\u2019t sanctioned. Fridman and the partners resigned from LetterOne board in the same year while the sanctions prevent them from getting proceeds from any deal. TWF has privately expressed concerns about potential risks to Turkcell from the sanctions, as the company is also listed in New York, the people said. Turkey, a NATO member, has refrained from joining its Western allies in imposing sanctions against Russia, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan maintaining friendly ties with President Vladimir Putin. TWF previously held informal discussions with potential buyers about selling its Turkcell stake, Bloomberg News reported in July. Some within the fund opposed a sale as the carrier is seen as a strategic asset, the people have said. Buying out LetterOne\\u2019s stake could make any potential future TWF\\u2019s divestment of its Turkcell shares easier, according to the people. Deliberations are preliminary and there\\u2019s no guarantee a deal would happen, the people said. Representatives for Turkcell and LetterOne declined to comment, while TWF didn\\u2019t respond to requests for comment. LetterOne and Turkcell were at odds before. In 2022, LetterOne called for the dismissal of four board members as it pushed for a governance overhaul to attract international investors. The board of Turkcell rejected most of LetterOne\\u2019s requests later. --With assistance from Yuliya Fedorinova.
